# AmaZone

I am starting to experiment with Xcode 4 and programming for Mac OS X.
I thought I would type in the code for the AmaZone application described in chapter 28 of
Cocoa Programming For Mac OS X, 3rd Edition.
However, I quickly discovered that requests to Amazon web services now require extra steps to be
taken compared to the code in the book.
This issue is discussed on the forum for the book :-
